title: Your first smart contract with Plinth (Linux)
permalink: /tutorials/first-smart-contract/
---
Before writing a real validator, it helps to get the whole toolchain working
end to end with the simplest possible Plinth program: a function that adds two
numbers. In this tutorial you will install `uplc-ghc`, create a tiny project
from scratch, compile it, run it, and read the Plutus Core it produced.

This tutorial targets **Linux**. Windows and macOS walkthroughs will follow
later.

## Before you start

You need on `PATH`:

- [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) 0.2.1.0 or newer (check with
  `ghcup --version`);
- a recent `cabal` (3.8 or newer);
- ghcup's `bin` directory, `~/.ghcup/bin` by default, where the compiler
  installed in step 1 lands. The standard ghcup setup adds it to `PATH`
  already.

The rest of the tutorial assumes the compiler is available as plain
`uplc-ghc`, which is what step 1 gives you. If you
[built it from source]({% link how-to/build.md %}) instead, replace `uplc-ghc`
with the path of the binary the build produced.

## Step 1: Install Plinth

`uplc-ghc` is distributed via ghcup as a custom tool named `plinth` (see
[Install Plinth standalone compiler]({% link how-to/install.md %}) for the
details). Add the Plinth release channel, then install and activate the tool:

```console
$ ghcup config add-release-channel https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/ghc-plinth/ghcup-channel/ghcup-plinth.yaml
$ ghcup install plinth latest
$ ghcup set plinth latest
```

Check that the compiler is on `PATH`:

```console
$ uplc-ghc --version
```

If you have already installed it this way, skip to step 2.

## Step 2: Create the project

Make a new directory and add the three files below.

**`cabal.project`** wires up the build. It points cabal at `uplc-ghc` and its
`ghc-pkg` (installed by ghcup as `uplc-ghc-pkg`, so that it does not collide
with your regular GHC); pulls the
Plinth libraries (`plutus-tx`, `plutus-core`) from the
`ghc-plinth-plutus` fork the compiler was built against; uses the Cardano
package repository (CHaP) for the remaining dependencies; and builds the Cardano
crypto C libraries (`libsodium`, `secp256k1`, `blst`) from source via the
`*-clib` blocks, so you do not need them installed on your system:

```haskell
with-compiler: uplc-ghc
with-hc-pkg:   uplc-ghc-pkg

packages: .

Use the `ghc-plinth-plutus` commit that matches your `uplc-ghc`: the compiler and
these libraries are released together as a matched set, built from the same
commit. The commit above matches releases 9.6.166.1 and 9.6.166.2 (the current ghcup
`latest`); for a different `uplc-ghc`, use the plutus commit it was built
from.

**Not for production.** The vendored crypto C libraries pulled in by the
`*-clib` `source-repository-package`s above have not been audited. Use this
setup for learning and experimentation only &mdash; never for contracts that
handle real funds.
{:.warning}

**`plinth-add.cabal`** describes the single executable. The `ghc-options` are
the flags Plinth needs to compile predictably (turning off optimisations that
would reshape the code before the plugin sees it) and to select the Plutus Core
version to target:

```haskell
cabal-version: 3.0
name:          plinth-add
version:       0.1.0.0
build-type:    Simple

executable plinth-add
  main-is:            Main.hs
  default-language:   Haskell2010
  default-extensions: DataKinds
  build-depends:
    , base
    , text
    , prettyprinter
    , plutus-tx
    , plutus-core
  ghc-options:
    -fexternal-interpreter
    -fobject-code -fno-full-laziness -fno-ignore-interface-pragmas
    -fno-omit-interface-pragmas -fno-spec-constr -fno-specialise
    -fno-strictness -fno-unbox-small-strict-fields
    -fno-unbox-strict-fields
    -fplugin-opt Plinth.Plugin:target-version=1.1.0
```

**`Main.hs`** is the whole program. It defines the on-chain function, compiles
it to Plutus Core with a Template Haskell splice, and writes the result out as
readable UPLC:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

module Main where

import PlutusTx
import qualified PlutusTx.Prelude as Tx
import qualified PlutusTx.Code as Code
import PlutusCore.Pretty (prettyPlcReadableSimple)
import Prettyprinter (defaultLayoutOptions, layoutPretty)
import Prettyprinter.Render.Text (renderStrict)
import Data.Text (unpack)

-- The on-chain function: add two integers.
addTyped :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
addTyped x y = x Tx.+ y

-- Compile it to Plutus Core at compile time.
addScript :: CompiledCode (Integer -> Integer -> Integer)
addScript = $$(compile [|| addTyped ||])

-- Render compiled code as readable UPLC text.
renderUPLC :: CompiledCode a -> String
renderUPLC =
    unpack
  . renderStrict
  . layoutPretty defaultLayoutOptions
  . prettyPlcReadableSimple
  . Code.getPlcNoAnn

main :: IO ()
main = writeFile "add.uplc" (renderUPLC addScript)
```

The typed quote `[|| addTyped ||]` and the `compile` splice are the only
Plinth-specific pieces; `PlutusTx.Prelude` (imported as `Tx`) supplies the
on-chain `+`, and everything else is ordinary Haskell.

## Step 3: Build it

```console
$ cabal update
$ cabal build
```

The first run clones and builds the Plinth libraries and the crypto C libraries
from source, so expect it to take a while. Because the Plinth plugin is built
into `uplc-ghc`, no extra plugin configuration is required: the `compile` splice
is translated to Plutus Core as part of the normal build.

## Step 4: Run it

```console
$ cabal run plinth-add
```

`main` runs and writes the compiled program to `add.uplc` in the current
directory.

## Step 5: Look at the Plutus Core

```console
$ cat add.uplc
```

You should see something like:

```
program 1.1.0 (\x y -> addInteger x y)
```

That is the [UPLC]({% link explanation/uplc.md %}) your two-line Haskell function
compiled to &mdash; the `+` became the `addInteger` builtin, wrapped in a
`program` with its [language version]({% link explanation/uplc.md %}). This is
exactly the kind of code the Cardano ledger executes, produced from Haskell by
`uplc-ghc`.

## Where to go next

- [Use uplc-ghc in a project]({% link how-to/use.md %}) &mdash; the same compiler
  setup, described on its own.
- [The Plinth contract language]({% link explanation/plinth-language.md %})
  &mdash; how a real validator is written, beyond this toy function.
- [Generate a blueprint]({% link how-to/generate-blueprint.md %}) &mdash; package
  a compiled script for off-chain tooling. (A tutorial walking through it on a
  small example is coming.)
- [Test a Plinth contract locally]({% link how-to/test.md %}) &mdash; evaluate a
  compiled validator and measure its execution budget, with no node.
