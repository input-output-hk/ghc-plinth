This guide explains how to get `uplc-ghc`, the
[Plinth standalone compiler]({% link explanation/standalone-compiler.md %}).

## Installing via ghcup

*Coming soon.* Installing `uplc-ghc` through
[ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) &mdash; the standard installer for
Haskell toolchains &mdash; is planned but not yet available. Until then, build
from source as described below.

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

`plinth-build.sh` expects the following tools on `PATH`:

| Tool      | Requirement                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `ghc`     | boot compiler `ghc-9.6.7`                            |
| `cabal`   | `>= 3.14.2.0`                                         |
| `happy`   | `happy-1.20.1.1` (built locally if missing)          |
| `alex`    | `alex-3.5.4.0` (built locally if missing)            |
| `python3` | required by Hadrian                                  |
| `tar`     | required to produce the binary distribution archive  |
| `xz`      | required to compress the binary distribution archive |

`happy` and `alex` are built locally into `_build/tools/` if they are not
found, so they are effectively optional. The others must be present.

### 1. Clone with submodules

The `plutus` submodule provides `plutus-tx`, `plutus-tx-plugin`, and
`plutus-core`, so clone recursively:

```console
$ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:hsyl20/ghc-plinth.git
```

If you already cloned without `--recurse-submodules`, fetch them with:

```console
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Run the build script

From the root of the repository:

```console
$ ./plinth-build.sh
```

The script bootstraps GHC and then builds `uplc-ghc`. What it produces is
described under [Build outputs](#build-outputs) below.

### Build options

`plinth-build.sh` is controlled by environment variables. The two most common
force a full rebuild or select the release flavour:

```console
$ REBUILD=1 ./plinth-build.sh   # re-boot, re-configure, and rebuild from scratch
$ RELEASE=1 ./plinth-build.sh   # release flavour, which also builds documentation
```

| Variable  | Default | Effect                                                        |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `REBUILD` | `0`     | Set to `1` to force a full rebuild (re-boot, re-configure).   |
| `RELEASE` | `0`     | Set to `1` to build the release flavour including documentation (more build dependencies). |

It also honours tool-location overrides such as `GHC`, `CABAL`, `HAPPY`,
`ALEX`, and `PYTHON`, as well as `HADRIAN_ARGS`, `CONFIGURE_ARGS`, and
`FLAVOUR`, when you need to point it at specific tools or change the build
flavour.

### Build outputs

When `plinth-build.sh` finishes it has produced two things.

**The compiler.** The development build is installed at:

```
_build/stage1/bin/uplc-ghc
```

This is the binary you point cabal at (see
[Use uplc-ghc in a project]({% link how-to/use.md %})).

**Binary distribution archive.** A relocatable bindist is produced under
`_build/bindist/`:

```
_build/bindist/ghc-<version>-<platform>.tar.xz
```

The build script fixes up the bindist so that it ships `uplc-ghc` (with the
built-in Plinth plugin) instead of the boot GHC:

- `uplc-ghc` is added (as `uplc-ghc-<version>` plus an `uplc-ghc` wrapper).
- The boot `ghc` binary is removed, so installing the bindist does not replace
  a user's existing GHC.
- `runghc` and `runhaskell` are renamed to `uplc-runghc` and `uplc-runhaskell`.

Installing the bindist therefore creates `$PREFIX/bin/uplc-ghc`.

## Test and benchmark

With `uplc-ghc` built, two scripts exercise it. Both run from the root of the
repository.

### Run the example project tests

```console
$ ./plinth-test.sh
```

It builds the example Plinth project under `plinth/test/` with `uplc-ghc` and
regenerates its expected outputs. Set `CLEAN=1` to force a clean rebuild:

```console
$ CLEAN=1 ./plinth-test.sh
```

### Run the benchmarks

`plinth-bench.sh` builds and runs the `plutus-benchmark` test-suites with
`uplc-ghc` and reports any diffs against the golden files committed under
`plutus/plutus-benchmark/` (it requires the `plutus` submodule):

```console
$ ./plinth-bench.sh
```

Each test-suite is a [tasty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty) runner.
When a golden comparison fails, the unified diff is streamed to stdout and an
`.actual` sidecar file is written next to the corresponding golden file under
`plutus/plutus-benchmark/*/test/`.
