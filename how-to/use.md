title: Use uplc-ghc in a project
permalink: /how-to/use/
---

The recommended way to use the Plinth standalone compiler is to set it once in
`cabal.project`. If you [installed it via ghcup]({% link how-to/install.md %})
(the recommended way), `uplc-ghc` is on `PATH` and its name alone is enough:

```haskell
with-compiler: uplc-ghc
with-hc-pkg:   uplc-ghc-pkg
packages: .
```

The `with-hc-pkg` line points cabal at the `ghc-pkg` that belongs to
`uplc-ghc`. ghcup installs it under the name `uplc-ghc-pkg`, so that it does
not collide with your regular GHC. Without this line, cabal looks for a
`ghc-pkg` next to the compiler. On Linux and macOS this finds the correct one
through the `uplc-ghc` symlink, but on Windows (where ghcup creates shims, not
symlinks) cabal picks up the `ghc-pkg.exe` of your regular GHC and fails with a
version mismatch.

Releases from 9.6.166.2 install the `uplc-ghc-pkg` link. If the command is not
found, update first:

```console
$ ghcup install plinth latest
$ ghcup set plinth latest
```

For a compiler built from source, give the path to the binary instead. The
matching `ghc-pkg` sits next to it, so `with-hc-pkg` is not needed:

```haskell
with-compiler: /path/to/uplc-ghc
```

The same file also needs the Cardano package repository (CHaP), which provides
the Cardano dependencies of the Plinth libraries:

```haskell
repository cardano-haskell-packages
  url: https://chap.intersectmbo.org/
  secure: True
  root-keys:
    3e0cce471cf09815f930210f7827266fd09045445d65923e6d0238a6cd15126f

  , hackage.haskell.org 2026-08-06T04:37:23Z
  , cardano-haskell-packages 2026-08-05T05:00:53Z
```

Adapt the two `index-state` dates to your project: they pin the CHaP and Hackage
package sets.

The Plinth libraries themselves (`plutus-tx`, `plutus-core`) are neither
bundled with the compiler nor taken from CHaP. Pull them from the
`ghc-plinth-plutus` fork that `uplc-ghc` was built against (`plutus-tx-plugin`
is not needed: the compiler is built into `uplc-ghc`):

```haskell
source-repository-package
  type: git
  location: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ghc-plinth-plutus
  tag: 2e582ecde824238f927322d208740322eada8115
  subdir: plutus-tx
          plutus-core
```

Use the `ghc-plinth-plutus` commit that matches your `uplc-ghc`: the compiler
and these libraries are released together as a matched set, built from the same
commit. The commit above matches releases 9.6.166.1 and 9.6.166.2 (the current ghcup
`latest`); for a different `uplc-ghc`, use the plutus commit it was built
from.

In addition you may want to add the following `source-repository-package` blocks
that build the C crypto libraries used by Cardano (`libsodium`, `secp256k1`,
`blst`) from source, so you do not need them installed on your system.

**Not for production.** The vendored crypto C libraries pulled in by the
`*-clib` `source-repository-package`s below have not been audited. Use this
setup for learning and experimentation only &mdash; never for contracts that
handle real funds.

Then refresh the package index and build:
