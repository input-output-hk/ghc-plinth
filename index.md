<!-- The wordmark animation. It plays once and stops on a frame identical to
     plinth-wordmark.png, so the clip and the still are interchangeable once it
     has finished. The poster is the animation's FIRST frame, not the finished
     mark -- see Note [The poster is the FIRST frame] in _logo/make-anim.sh.
     Two sources so there is always a playable one; anyone who has asked for
     less motion gets the still instead, via the swap below.

     width/height give the aspect ratio up front so the page does not jump on
     load. They are presentational hints, and this site has no global
     "height: auto" rule to cancel the height one, hence it in the style. -->

    .wordmark-anim  { display: none; }

Documentation for the **Plinth** compiler, a language for writing on-chain and
off-chain code for the [Cardano][cardano] blockchain. Plinth (formerly Plutus
Tx) is a subset of [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) compiled to **Plutus
Core**.

## Finding your way around

This documentation follows the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework,
which separates docs into four kinds by what you need from them:

- **[Explanation]({% link explanation/index.md %})** &mdash;
  *understanding-oriented.* Background and discussion: what Plinth is and how
  the compiler works.
- **[Tutorials]({% link tutorials/index.md %})** &mdash; *learning-oriented.*
  Start here if you are new: a hands-on lesson that walks you through compiling
  your first smart contract.
- **[How-to guides]({% link how-to/index.md %})** &mdash; *task-oriented.*
  Practical recipes for a specific job: install the compiler, use it in a
  project, and generate a blueprint.
- **[Reference]({% link reference/index.md %})** &mdash; *information-oriented.*
  Dry facts to look up.
